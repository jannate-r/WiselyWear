**User Stories:**
* Anna wants to check the weather for her location. She opens the weather app and immediately sees the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation forecast. The app also displays a brief description of the weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, etc.) and the expected conditions for the next few hours. **[team story]**

* Anna wants to check the current weather for her location. She opens the weather app and immediately sees the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. In addition, she is shown the "feels like" temperature, which accounts for the human perception of weather, helping her understand how the weather actually feels outside. **[Diana]**

* Anna wants to know the likelihood of rainfall today in her location. She presses on the precipitation forecast and the probability of that event is displayed. She then explored the hourly forecast, where she found detailed predictions for temperature, rain chances, and wind speed for the next several hours. She can also find the weather forecast for the next seven days.**[Daniil]**

* Anna wishes to receive updates exclusively when specific weather conditions (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) occur in her area. She can specify both the specific conditions she wants to be alerted about and the time period in advance for which she wants the alert to be set. If these trigger conditions are met, the service will generate an alert for Anna. **[Chika]**

* Anna wants to view the weather map with various layers, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and pressure, allowing her to monitor the current, forecast, and historical weather conditions in an interactive and visual format.**[Jannate]**

* Anna wants to know if her outfit is suitable for todayâ€™s weather. She takes a photo of herself and submits it through the app. OpenAI analyzes her outfit and suggests that she wears a sweater because the weather is chilly, and sunglasses for the bright sun. Anna can also view alternative outfit suggestions based on the forecast. **[Kush]**
